# Visualization using BERT Sentence Embeddings

This repository contains code for performing semantic search and visualization of text data using BERT sentence embeddings. The project utilizes the SentenceTransformers library along with other Python libraries for natural language processing and visualization.

## Overview

Semantic search is the task of retrieving information based on the meaning of the query rather than just keyword matching. This project demonstrates how to use BERT-based sentence embeddings to perform semantic search on a corpus of text data. It also includes visualization techniques to understand the semantic similarity between sentences.

## Features

- Utilizes BERT-based SentenceTransformer model for encoding sentences into fixed-size vectors.
- Performs semantic search using cosine similarity between query and corpus sentences.
- Visualizes sentence embeddings in 2D space using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
- Generates a heatmap visualization of cosine similarity between sentences in the corpus.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- SentenceTransformers
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
